# Image and Video Processing Assignments

This repository contains assignments completed as part of the **Image and Video Processing** course. The course covers a wide range of topics in digital image and video processing, including:

- **Image Processing**: Intensity transformation, spatial and frequency domain filtering, edge detection, Hough transform, image restoration, color processing, segmentation, and more.
- **Object Recognition and Compression**: Shape and texture representation, object recognition, JPEG compression.
- **Video Processing**: Video compression standards, motion estimation, and digital video concepts.

Additionally, the repository includes a **Mini Project** that implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for facial analysis using **Python**.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **MATLAB**: For most of the assignments (image and video processing).
- **Python**: For the CNN-based facial analysis mini project.

## Topics Covered:
- Image Enhancement and Filtering
- Edge Detection and Point/Line Detection
- Image Segmentation and Thresholding
- Object Recognition and Compression
- Video Compression and Motion Estimation
- Facial Analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
